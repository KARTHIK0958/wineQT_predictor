## Getting Started

To use and experiment with this Wine Quality Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-predictor.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd wine-quality-predictor`
3. Install the required libraries and dependencies (see [Installation](#installation) section).
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for training and making predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality Data" dataset, which contains information about various attributes of wines and their associated quality ratings. You can find the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

## Installation

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6+)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration)
- Pandas (for data handling)
## Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script.
Load the dataset.
Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and scaling features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
Make predictions on new data or test data.
Visualize the results using plots and graphs.
## Results
The Wine Quality Predictor provides a linear regression model that can estimate the quality of wines based on the provided dataset. The model's performance can be assessed using various evaluation metrics, and predictions can be made for new wine samples.
